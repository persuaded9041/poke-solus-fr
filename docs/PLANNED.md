# Pokémon Solus RGB: Planned Features

Some possible changes/features I have planned for future releases.

### For the game
- Restore Rival's unused victory speeches (unused content)
- Make only the fossil that was _not_ chosen in Mt. Moon appear in the new Victory Road Fossil Room (right now, both fossils will appear there regardless of the player's early-game choice)

### For the repository
- Add config command line flags for users to modify certain settings while building the ROMs:
    - Which sprite sets are used for front sprites (R/B, R/G, Yellow, Solus, Space World 97)
    - Which back sprite sets are used (original low-res(?), Space World high-res, Gen 2 high-res, and potentially a newly-curated 'Solus set' for back sprites as well)
    - Change the starters to any Pokémon (to allow for more varied early games)
    - Hard mode (boss trainers like Gym Leaders would have modified parties, mostly)
