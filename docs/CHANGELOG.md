# Pokémon Solus RGB: Changelog

An overview of the changes made in each release.

## v1.5
- Added Jynx to Seafoam Islands B2F and B4F (its absence in the wild in Solus was an oversight; all Pokémon are now obtainable without needing to utilize any in-game trades)
- Adjusted Super Game Boy color palettes in battle so that EXP bar no longer matches player's HP bar (it now matches the yellow used as the accent color in the Pokéball icons at the start of the battle)
    - In Game Boy Color mode, the EXP bar no longer matches the HP bar's color; it now uses the lighter shade of whichever version you're playing
- Added unused text and Pokédex popup (Porygon) for the computer monitor on 11F of Silph Co. (unused content)
- Adjusted wording in Field Move text
    - "Teach this as a temporary FIELD MOVE?" --> "Teach as a FIELD MOVE?"
    - "A temporary FIELD MOVE is already learned! Put this Pokémon in a PC BOX to erase it." --> "A FIELD MOVE is already learned! Deposit this Pokémon in a BOX to forget it."

## v1.4
- Fixed a bug for the Victory Road Fossil Room warp which warped you outside Victory Road instead of back to 1F

## v1.3
- Changed wording in Field Move teaching prompt: "Learn this as a temporary FIELD MOVE?" -> "Teach this as a temporary FIELD MOVE?" 
- Changed Blaine's sprite to the Silph President sprite, like in Yellow Version
- Changed type matchup for `GHOST -> PSYCHIC` to 2x effectiveness (Super Effective) instead of 0x effectiveness
- Changed move typing for Karate Chop, Gust, and Sand-Attack to match the Gen 2 updates (now `FIGHTING`, `FLYING`, and `GROUND` respectively)
- Added an animated in-battle EXP bar to the HUD
- Added an in-battle 'already caught' indicator to the HUD (the icon is the one used in Gen 2)
- Implemented partially forward-patched learnsets via Gen 2 tradeback learnsets (check [here](./FEATURES.md#learnsets) for details)
- Added TM51 (Flamethrower), TM52 (Fire Punch), TM53 (Ice Punch), and TM54 (Thunderpunch) to support the newly forward-patched Pokémon learnsets
    - The TM pamphlet on the top floor of Celadon Mansion has been updated accordingly (the text now mentions 54 TMs instead of 50)
- Added Bill's father, a new NPC in Bill's grandfather's house in Fuchsia City; he will sell you a Flamethrower TM for 8000p (as he is the Move Tutor in Crystal Version who teaches Flamethrower, he is a good fit for the role)
- Added new Clerk on 2F of Celadon Dept. Store who sells the 3 new elemental punch TMs
- Moved the 3 Field Move TMs (Dig, Teleport, Softboiled) to the new Clerk on 2F of Celadon Dept. Store (instead of the vanilla TM Clerk)

    - Solus developer (me)
    - Game disassembly (pret)
