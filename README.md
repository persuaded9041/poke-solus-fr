## Elevator pitch

_Pokémon Solus RGB_ is a minimal, near-vanilla romhack of Gen 1 (Red & Blue). It aims to enhance the solo gameplay experience by mitigating the need for trading, and "forward-patching" some features and learnset updates from Yellow and Gen 2. It changes _only a few things_ from the original games, without overhauling so much that it ceases to be Gen 1 (and thus becomes a [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)).

### Quick overview of changes
1. All 151 Pokémon are obtainable through in-game means (without the need for in-game trades)
2. Field Moves: HMs can be taught to party Pokémon without using up one of their move slots
3. Four new TMs have been added to support forward-patched learnsets (Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunderpunch, Flamethrower)
4. Trades can be performed in-game via the Trader NPC
5. Battle HUD additions: EXP bar and 'already caught' indicator
6. Professor Oak can be battled after beating the Pokémon League
7. Pokémon learnsets have been partially forward-patched via Yellow Version and Gen 2 tradeback learnsets
8. Exclusive Solus sprite set (a collection of the developer's favorites)
9. Some bugs/oversights from vanilla are fixed (Ghost is now super effective against Psychic, Focus Energy no longer quarters critical hit chance, etc.)

For a detailed look at _all_ the changes, check out the [Feature Log][featurelog].

## Versions

There are three versions of this romhack: _Solus Red_, _Solus Green_, and _Solus Blue_. The differences between versions are solely cosmetic (palettes, title screen text, etc.), as this project consolidates any of the meaningful version-specific differences that existed across versions, such as Pokémon availability. Check [here][versiondifferences] for a complete list of version differences.

_Note_: If played on Game Boy Color, _Solus Green_ uses the GBC's built-in green "duochrome" palette. This is the same one which was used by the Japanese release of Pokémon Green Version.

## Installation

### Building all three ROMs from source

If you're new to the [`pokered`][pokered] disassembly, learn how to install prerequisites and build the ROMs in the [install guide][installation].

Otherwise, if your environment for building the vanilla ROMs is already set up, the procedure here is the same. Just clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `make`.

### Modifying this romhack
If you want to make some tweaks to this romhack before building the ROMs, or if you want to use this romhack as a starting point for your own, read [this document][howtomod] that I've written.
