Pokémon Solus RGB is a near-vanilla "faithful" romhack of Pokémon Red/Blue for Game Boy, with a focus on an enhanced **solo gameplay experience**. It is based on the [disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue][pokered].

For a detailed look at all the changes in this romhack, check out the [feature log][featurelog].

## Elevator pitch

**Pokémon Solus RGB** is a near-vanilla romhack of Gen 1. It changes _only a few things_ from the original games, without overhauling so much that it ceases to be Gen 1, and the whole thing becomes a [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) paradox.

Quick overview of changes:
1. All 151 Pokémon are obtainable through normal means
2. Some new gameplay features have been added
    - HMs can be taught to party Pokémon without using up one of their move slots
    - Four new TMs have been added to support forward-patched learnsets
    - Trades can be performed in-game via the Trader NPC
    - Battle HUD additions: EXP bar and 'already caught' indicator
    - Professor Oak can be battled after beating the Pokémon League
3. Pokémon learnsets have been partially forward-patched via Yellow Version and Gen 2 tradeback learnsets
4. Some visual content is changed (sprites)
5. Some bugs/oversights from vanilla are fixed

For a detailed look at all the changes, check out the [feature log][featurelog].

## Versions

There are three versions of this romhack: _Solus Red_, _Solus Green_, and _Solus Blue_. The differences between versions are solely cosmetic (palettes, title screen text, etc.), as this project consolidates any of the meaningful version-specific differences that existed across versions, such as Pokémon availability. For a complete list of version differences, check [here][versiondifferences].

[Building from source](#building-all-three-roms-from-source) will yield three ROMs:

- Solus Red (`pokesolusred.gbc`)
- Solus Green (`pokesolusgreen.gbc`)
- Solus Blue (`pokesolusblue.gbc`)

_Note_: Solus Green, if played on Game Boy Color, uses the GBC's built-in mostly-green palette. This is the same one which was used by the Japanese release of Pokémon Green Version.

## Installation

### Patching a vanilla ROM

To patch a vanilla Pokémon Red/Blue Version ROM, download a `.bps` patch file from the [releases page][releases], and then apply it to your ROM using [this online patcher](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) or your patcher of choice.
- For Solus Red / Solus Green, patch a vanilla Red Version ROM
- For Solus Blue, patch a vanilla Blue Version ROM

### Building all three ROMs from source

If you're new to the [`pokered`][pokered] disassembly, learn how to install prerequisites and build the ROMs in the [install guide][installation].

Otherwise, if your environment for building the vanilla ROMs is already set up, the procedure here is the same. Just clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `make`.

#### Modifying this romhack
If you want to make some tweaks to this romhack before building the ROMs, or if you want to use this romhack as a starting point for your own, read [this document][howtomod] that I've written.
